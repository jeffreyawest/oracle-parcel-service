        Welcome to the Oracle Parcel Service JSF 2.0 + PrimeFaces Example application!
      </p>

      <p>
        This application has two core use cases: 'Ship' and 'Track'.
        You can create a Shipment with multiple Parcels and then use the 'Track' function to track it's whereabouts.
      </p>

      <p>
        The application has the ability to simulate tracking events for packages
        that are submitted through the web application.
      </p>

      <p>
        This application also has two modes - Customer mode and Admin Mode. Admin mode has utility
        functionas that are not applicable to the core use cases of the application.
        To change modes, click the link at the bottom of the page.
